    ##### adding context to mail
    text = message.as_string()   
    context = ssl.create_default_context()

    ##### sending email
    with smtplib.SMTP_SSL("smtp.gmail.com", 465, context=context) as server:
        server.login(sender_email, password)
        server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, text)
    print(receiver_email + ' got mail')
